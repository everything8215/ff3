0x0000:  The Gurgan quietly spoke…
         This earthquake is but an
        omen. The tremors that pulled
        the Crystals into the earth
         and brought forth monsters
        are nothing compared to the
         Darkness which is to come…
        
          But,hope is not yet lost.
         Four souls will take up the
             quest of the Light.
        
              And so it begins…
0x0001: 
           Four orphans have been
        raised by the priest Topapa
        in the remote village of Ur.
        
        A Crystal has sunk into the
        earth due to the earthquake,
        and the four boys have come
          in an adventurous mood.
        
         They had only intended to
            test their courage…
0x0002: Sara:Oh,yes.
         To talk to me,press B.
         Don't forget!
0x0003: Can't move!
        ‘Now,get them!!’
0x0004: Ahh,thanks to you my hip
        pains have gotten better.
        Please,take this.
        
        Received EchoHerb!
        
0x0005: “Princess Sara…”
        Sara:Be sure to come back.
         I'll be waiting!
0x0006: “Ouch…!”
        “We've fallen into a pit!”
        “Shucks…”
0x0007: “Are we gonna be all right?
         In a place like this?”
        “Hey! It was your idea to
         come here!”
        “Hey,if you've got time to
         fight,you've got time to
         look for a way out!”
        
0x0008: “Wh…what were those!?”
        “Oh man…”
        “What're we gonna do now?”
0x0009: “Wh…what is this!?”
        Something evil attacked!
0x000A: “It's Jinn!”
        Sara:I'll seal him with
         this ring!
0x000B: Jinn:Fuhahaha… That thing
         won't work on me now.
         I've allied with the
         great power of Darkness!
0x000C: “Now,Sara!
         Seal Jinn with the ring
         while he's weak!”
        Sara raised the ring…
0x000D: Sara:Thank you.
         Because of you,we were
         able to seal Jinn again.
        
         Now if we put this ring
         in Sasoon's holy spring
         we can release Jinn's
         curse.
         Let's use the ring's
         power to warp back to
         Sasoon castle!
        
0x000E: Sara:Thanks for your help.
         I guess this is goodbye…
         I mustn't leave my
         father's side.
         I'd like to go with
         you,but I'm sure I'd
         just get in the way.
        “Sara…”
        Sara:Please come back and
         visit when your journey
         is over. I'll be waiting…
        
0x000F: I knew you could do it!
        I'm sure you can make
        better use of the airship
        than I could.
        Anyway,take me to the town
        of Canaan where Granny's
        waiting. Please!
        
        Cid joined the party!
        
0x0010: Just tell me if there's
        anything I can do for you…
        Ah! Maybe you could use
        another airship.
        Go see King Argass!
        The king knows the secret
        of airships.
        Come back again anytime!
0x0011: Welcome to the
        Tower of Owen.
        It will be your grave…
0x0012: Just keep wandering
        forever…
0x0013: Heeheehee…
0x0014: Ouch!
        An invisible wall!
0x0015: Wait!
        I'll dissolve the magic.
0x0016: Now you can pass.
        Place the horn on the
        altar!
0x0017: Hahaha!
        I've been following you
        in your shadows!
        Now I've got both horns!
0x0018: You ignorant fools!
        This Horn of Ice will
        open the path to the
        Crystal of Fire!
        Now the power of Fire
        will belong to me!
        
0x0019: Clank! Bang! Clack!
        ‘Alright,take them away.
         They'll make fine slaves
         at Sir Hyne's castle!’
0x001A: “Alright! We're all tiny!”
        “Let's go!”
        Entered the hole where the
        dragon's eye used to be!
0x001B: Fuhahaha!
        I've taken the power
        of the Crystal of Fire
        and become even stronger!
        But until I destroy you
        who have been blessed by
        the Light,I won't possess
        the true power of Fire…
        Sorry,but I guess you'll
        just have to die!
        
0x001C: The voice of Bahamut:
        ‘Wonderful!
         See if you can beat me!’
0x001D: The Crystal began to
        sparkle…
        ‘You have been chosen…’
        “Hey,the Crystal talked!”
        ‘Take the last of the
         light… last of the hope…
         remaining in me.
        
         At this rate,this light
         will soon vanish as well…
         The balance of everything
         is crumbling.
         When you take the Light
         you will be able to
         receive great strength
         from the Crystals.
         You are the ones chosen
         to keep the hope.
         You must not let this
         world disappear…’
        Light surrounded the four…
        
0x001E: You can go outside through
        that magic circle.
        Your quest begins here…
        Light Warriors!
0x001F: Light Warriors…
        I shall offer you the
        spirit of Light that
        sleeps within the Flame!
        Received Jobs from the
        Crystal of Fire!
        
0x0020: ‘This door was built to
         guard the Altar of Water.
         Only a Maiden of Water
         can open it.’
        Elia falls to her knees,
        praying…
        
0x0021: Sealed.
0x0022: Elia:Crystal of Water!
         Take back the Light!
        Elia returned the shard's
        light to the Crystal…
0x0023: Elia:Noooo!!
0x0024: Elia:Uunh…
        “Elia!”
        Elia:\xchar……
        “Elia…!!”
0x0025: You were lucky my Cursed
        Arrow didn't get you,
        Light Warriors.
        It's a quick killer.
        Sent by Sir Zande to
        shatter the Crystal of
        Water, I am Kraken!
        Perish!!
0x0026: “Elia…!”
        
        
        
        Elia:The Light has returned
         to the Crystal… I couldn't
         have done it without you…
        “Elia! Don't speak!”
        Elia:Please,take these…
         These are the Jobs that
         carry the power of Water…
        
        Received the Jobs of Water
        from Elia!
        
0x0027: “An earthquake! Run!”
        “No! We can't leave Elia…”
        “Look out!”
        “UWAAAAH……!!”
0x0028: ‘You're awake? You've been
         asleep for three days!’
        “Where are we?”
        
        ‘This is Amur,the town of
         water. Grandpa found you
         lying unconscious in the
         Temple of Water.’
0x0029: “Three whole days…”
0x002A: “Elia! Get up!”
        Elia:No… I’m done for…
         Please go and restore
         peace… for my sake too…
        “Elia…!”
        Elia:Goodbye……
        “ELIAAAA……!!”
        
0x002B: Old man:Aiee!! Help us!!
        “Hey,it's those old guys
         we just saw!”
        “Let's help them!”
0x002C: ‘We're sorry.
         Thanks for helping us
         out of that predicament.
        
         Did you really think we
         were the four legendary
         heroes!? No way!
         Fuhahaha!’
0x002D: Hyahyahya!
        You kids,the four
        legendary heroes…
        Unbelieveable…
        Well,here are the
        Floating Shoes!
        Catch!!
        
0x002E: Old men:Stand back!!
0x002F: ‘Those Shoes are fakes!’
        “How do you know?”
        
        
        ‘Why,it's my sixth sense!
         …Just kidding.
         I've seen the shoes
         before.’
0x0030: Old man:Hey Delila,these
         kids are the real heroes!
        Delila:Oh! I had no idea.
         I’m terribly sorry.
        Old man:Delila,won't you
         lend them the shoes?
        Delila:Well,since you asked…
         Here,take these.
0x0031: Received Floating Shoes!
        “Yeah! Now we can cross the
         Bottomless Swamp.”
        
        “Thanks,old guys! You guys
         make great heroes.”
        Old man:Hohoho!
         We're not that great!
         Well,let's get out of
         here. Hold on to me,kids.
         I'll use \whiteExit to take
         us out!
0x0032: ‘Well well,this kid seems
         to think he's the Prince.
         Heh,what a laugh!’
0x0033: ‘Oh,what's the matter,
         Your Highness? Come on!’
        “Hey,stop that!”
0x0034: ‘Who the hell are you!?’
        ‘Get ’em,guys!’
0x0035: ‘Ow… Don't hurt us!’
        ‘Please forgive us!’
0x0036: ‘I am Prince Allus,son
         of King Gorn of Salonia.
         Thank you for saving me!’
        “What the heck's going on?”
        Allus:My father suddenly
         started a civil war.
         I tried to stop him,
         but he didn't listen…
         I've been banished from
         the castle. I beg you,
         travelers,won't you
         help me?
         I want to go back to the
         castle and ask my father
         why he's doing this…
        
        “We understand.”
        Allus:Thank you!
        
        
        Allus joined the party!
        
0x0037: ‘Who is it?’
0x0038: ‘Don't you know this is
         the Wizard Dorga's home?
         Attack them!!’
        ‘Nyaah!!’
0x0039: Mmhmm,and you are…?
0x003A: Hmm! You're the four
        Light Warriors,aren't you.
        So,the Crystals have given
        their power to humans…
        Then there's something I
        must speak to you about…
        
0x003B: Dorga:Come this way…
         Unne and I have prepared
         something for you!
0x003C: Dorga:Go south of Salonia…
         To the Temple of Time on
         the bottom of the sea at
         the two-pronged cape…
         Noah's Lute should
         be there…
        “Noah's Lute?”
        
        Dorga:A lute whose sound
         echoes across this world
         and the world of dreams.
        
         Use it to bring Unne back
         from the Dream World.
         I shall go and get the
         key to Eureka.
         You awaken Unne and get
         the Great Ship!
        
0x003D: The Magic Circle Cave will
        soon disappear. I'll warp
        you outside.
        Farewell,Light Warriors!
0x003E: Who dares wake me from
        my peaceful slumber…
0x003F: I am Leviathan. I shall
        only lend my power to
        those with the Light!
        Are you worthy?
0x0040: The phantom Lute,
        sealed in time…
        Noah's Lute began
        playing a song…
0x0041: Unne:Leave it to me!
         If I strike it with the
         rock of the Dream World,
        
         even Adamantite should
         vanish into the cleft
         of dimensions.
        
         It's dangerous,so watch
         from over there…
        
0x0042: It's the Earth Crystal…
        ‘Under order of Sir Zande,
         I shall bury you in the
         Darkness!!’
0x0043: Light Warriors,one called
        Zande is abusing my power
        to plunge the world into
        darkness.
        Take the power which lies
        within me,and rid this
        world of the Dark Cloud!’
        
        Received Jobs from the
        Crystal of Earth!
        
0x0044: Hahaha… you're trapped!
        Anyone reflected in that
        mirror is trapped by the
        Demon Dragons’ curse!
        Now you can be the Five
        Demon Dragons’ prey!
        
0x0045: It's your long-awaited
        deliciously fresh feast!
        Take your time!
        
        “Shit!!”
        “I can't move!!”
        
0x0046: ‘Pull yourselves together!’
        “Dorga!?”
        
        
        Dorga:The only thing that
         can break the curse of
         the Demon Dragons is
         five hearts of Light…
         You must endure until I
         can find five hearts
         of Light!
         Don't give up!
        Dorga's soul searched for
        five of the Light…
        
0x0047: Dorga:Princess! \xchar
         and the others are
         in danger!
        
         What can lift the Demon
         Dragons’ curse is a heart
         filled with Light…
         We need your strength!
        Sara:What! \xchar
         is in danger!?
         I'll go!
         Please,take me with you!
0x0048: Dorga:Cid,won't you lend
         us your strength?
        
        
        Cid:Anything to help them!
         I’m going with you!
        
0x0049: Dorga:Desh…
         So you've died…
        
        
        Desh:Urrgh!!
        
0x004A: Dorga:Desh,you're alive!
        
        
        
        Desh:What are you talking
         about,old man?
         There's no way I'd die!
        
         I've finally finished
         fixing the Tower of Owen.
         That wasn't safe…
        
         Just a little longer and
         the Floating Continent
         would've collapsed!
        
        Dorga:\xchar and the
         others are in danger…
        Desh:One problem after
         another! What can I do?
0x004B: Dorga:Prince Allus,please
         give me your strength!
        
        
        Allus:\xchar is in danger?
         I'll go too!
        
0x004C: Dorga:Please,won't one of
         you come to help \xchar?
        
        
        Old man:It's finally our
         turn to be the heroes!
        
0x004D: ‘Light Warriors!’
        ‘Hurry,while we hold off
         the Demon Dragons!’
        
        ‘Don't let this world be
         plunged into darkness!’
        
0x004E: “Thank you everyone!”
        “Let's go!!”
0x004F: The Sylx Tower was built
        by concentrating the power
        of Light.
        
        Zande is trying to summon
        the Dark Cloud there
        using our power.
        
        Light Warriors,go to the
        Sylx Tower and stop the
        Demon King Zande!
        
0x0050: The flood of Darkness
        cannot be stopped!
        You fools shall die here!
0x0051: I am one of the four
        Dark Warriors…
        
        
        Light and Dark…
        Two worlds that pull at
        each other.
        
        And when those two worlds
        mix into one, a world of
        Void will be born.
        
        The Light is losing its
        power and the Dark is
        pushing it aside.
        
        This is the flood of
        Darkness. The only ones
        who can prevent this are
        you,the Light Warriors…
        Now,I shall lend you
        my power!
        The world must not
        return to the Void!
0x0052: We'll make the Darkness
        overflow and erase this
        world completely!
        Die,Light Warriors!
0x0053: I am one of the four
        Dark Warriors…
        
        
        The world began in Void
        and shall end in Void.
        But there is a force
        which can prevent this.
        A force which you call…
        Hope…
        
        
        Perhaps the world will once
        again return to the void…
        
        
        But still in the worlds
        of Light and Dark there
        is hope and love left to
        fight this.
        Go,destroy those who would
        return the world to Void!
        With the hope of Light
        and Dark!
0x0054: You've done well to make it
        so far. But now it's over.
        The flood of Darkness will
        return the world to Void!
0x0055: I am one of the four
        Dark Warriors…
        
        
        When the power of Dark or
        Light becomes too great,
        a Dark Cloud will be born,
        and plunge all into Void…
        The thing which can defeat
        the Dark Cloud is the hope
        of both Light and Dark.
        Let us fight together!
0x0056: Soon,the Darkness will
        overflow completely!
        Nobody can stop it now!
        You shall perish here!
0x0057: I am one of the four Dark
        Warriors…
        
        
        The flood of Darkness will
        destroy not only your
        world,but ours as well.
        Both will return to Void…
        But if we join our forces,
        we may still have time!
        Quickly,let us go and
        defeat the Dark Cloud!
0x0058: I am the Dark Cloud!
        I will turn both this world
        and your world of Light
        back into utter Void…!
0x0059: “We won't let you
         do that!”
        
        
        Dark Cloud:Hahaha…
         This is the Dark World.
         I cannot be defeated here
         with the power of Light!
0x005A: Dark Warriors:It's not
         just the Light Warriors!
         We'll hold off your
         dark power!
        Dark Cloud:What!? If you
         do that, you'll perish!
        
        
        Dark Warriors:We will not
         allow you to return this
         world to the Void!
        
0x005B: Dark Cloud:The power of
         the Dark Crystals is
         lost,but I don't need it
         anymore!
         I'll defeat you,and then
         turn this world into Void
         with your power of Light!
         Perish,Light Warriors!
0x005C: Dark Cloud:It's futile…
         You cannot defeat me!
         Hahahahahahahaha……
0x005D: Dorga:You made it!
         Now,to make the Eureka
         Key complete…
        
         You must battle and
         defeat Unne and me!
        “What!?”
        
0x005E: Dorga:Listen. Long ago…
         Weapons too powerful for
         people to handle were
         sealed in Eureka.
         But now those weapons are
         necessary!
        
        
         And to make the key to
         enter Eureka,the energy
         of our battle is needed.
        
        “No matter what you say,
         Dorga,Unne…
         There's no way we could
         fight you!”
        Dorga:You stubborn fools!
         Then how about this?
         Defeat me,or die!
        
0x005F: “Dorga! Don't die!”
        Unne:Next is my turn!
        “No,Unne!”
        “We don't want to fight!”
        Unne:Oh,don't whine.
         Even if my body dies,my
         soul will not perish…
         Now,let's go!
0x0060: “Dorga! Unne!”
0x0061: Dorga:Alright,now the
         Eureka Key is complete.
         Take this with you…
        
        Received Eureka Key.
        
        
        
        “Dorga!!”
        Dorga:Don't worry. Though
         our bodies may die,our
         souls will not be lost…
         Now,go to the tower
         protected by the four
         statues,the Sylx Tower.
        
         You must stop the one who
         is trying to summon the
         Darkness,Zande.
        
         I feel safe knowing the
         duty is in your hands.
         The entrance to Eureka is
         in the Sylx Tower…
0x0062: Unne:Take this…
         It's the Sylx Key. The
         key that opens the sealed
         door in the Sylx Tower.
         I'll always be watching
         over you.
         I’m counting on you……
        “Unne!!”
        Received Sylx Key.
        
0x0063: If you can withstand my
        power I shall give you the
        Jobs of Ninja and Sage!
0x0064: Obtained \staffEldest!
        And…
        
        
        Gained the Jobs of Ninja,
        who can use every weapon,
        and Sage,who can use
        every magic!
0x0065: “OK,do we dive in?”
        “No way!”
        “Only a frog could make
         it in there…”
0x0066: “If we go in this hole…”
        “Impossible!”
        “We'd have to be tiny to
         fit in there…”
0x0067: Unlocked!
0x0068: Teeheehee!
        I'm a dancer!
0x0069: I am the ultimate sword,
        Ragnarok!
        It's still too early
        for you to use me!
0x006A: I'll lend my help to
        your Light.
        Take me in your hands!
        
        Obtained \swordRagnarok!
        
0x006B: I'm Cid.
        I invented the airship!
        I'm famous!!
0x006C: I must get back to
        Canaan. We've gotta do
        something about that
        rock blocking the valley…
0x006D: My dear wife is
        waiting for me in Canaan!
0x006E: If we mounted a Mithril
        bow on the airship,we
        could smash the boulder
        by ramming it.
        Maybe if we asked Taca,
        the blacksmith of Kazus…
        
0x006F: The airship's been
        fitted with a Mithril bow!
        Let's ram it into the
        big rock!
0x0070: Unne:We can rest in the
        bed in the back.
0x0071: Unne:Hang in there!
         Let's meet again at
         Dorga's house!
0x0072: Unne:Remember this well.
         If you go down that
         stairway, you can return
         to the ground.
         To get back aboard the
         airship,stand in the
         ship's shadow on the
         ground and press A.
         Also,press A to put the
         engine in high gear and
         fly over mountains.
         The B button stops flight.
         Take the wheel,and you
         can fly away.
         Got it?
        
0x0073: Unne:Follow me!
0x0074: Unne:These things are like
         vending machines. You can
         buy items from them.
0x0075: Unne:I've also put a Fat
         Chocobo on board here.
         Come on out!
        
        
0x0076: Unne:Dorga is calling…
        “Huh? Are you leaving?”
        Unne:Yes. The rest is up
         to you.
         First,obtain the Earth
         Fang which lies in the
         Cave of Darkness to the
         north of Amur.
         Then,come to Dorga's
         house.
         We'll have something
         to give you.
0x0077: Nothing happens.
0x0078: Presenting…
        The Fat Chocobo!
        
0x0079: Sara:I'm Sara.
         Who might you be?
        “I'm \xchar.”
        Sara:Nice to meet you!
0x007A: I came here alone and
        got stuck! I’m so lucky
        you came. Thanks a ton!!
0x007B: I have to seal Jinn
        with this ring and save
        everyone!
        Take me to Jinn!
0x007C: Jinn is a flame devil.
        He must be weak against
        the cold…
0x007D: 
0x007E: Obtained Earth Fang!
        
        
        
        “Alright! Now,back to
         Dorga's house. Dorga and
         Unne are waiting!”
        
0x007F: Splendid!
        Well then,take this blade.
        
        
        Received \darkswordKiku!
        
0x0080: When you're tiny,your
        defense power is only 1…
        You'd better all fall back
        to the rear row!
        And you ought to use the
        power of the Crystals.
        It'll be tough without
        about three Black Wizards…
0x0081: “Ouch…”
0x0082: 
0x0083: “Let's sleep in the
         Princess’ bed!”
0x0084: Die!!
0x0085: Put Nepto's Eye in the
        socket.
0x0086: I am the sea dragon Nepto.
        I thank you for returning
        the gem to me.
        
        This gem is my mind.
        Without it,I am merely an
        animal… and I begin to go
        wild.
        Here,take this.
        The Water Fang… it will
        smash what blocks your way
        with the power of Water…
        Received Water Fang!
        
0x0087: The water has lost its
        Light. Someone has caused
        an earthquake and sealed
        the Light underground.
        Please.
        Bring back the Light…
        
        
        The sea dragon Nepto
        fell into a deep sleep…
        
0x0088: Wow!!
        Thanks to you I’m
        feeling much better!
        Thank you so much!
0x0089: I'm saved!
        It must have been
        something I ate.
        But I'm fine now!
0x008A: Why don't you try
        going down the stairs?
        They lead to a hidden
        road to Myraluka.
        Heard about the
        Hidden Road!
        
0x008B: With this Time Gear,I can
        rebuild the Enterprise into
        an airship!
        Just lend me that box!
0x008C: It's finished!!
        Press A to transform into
        an airship!
        
        But it can still only land
        in the sea…
        Maybe I'm losing my touch!?
        
0x008D: ‘Shards of the Crystal
         of Water cannot be
         touched by anyone but the
         maiden of water,Elia…’
        “Elia…?”
        
0x008E: The seal vanished.
        Elia:Alright,let's go.
0x008F: Delila:What do you want?
        “We were just wondering if
         you could lend us the
         Floating Shoes…”
0x0090: Can't carry anymore.
0x0091: Odin:Light Warriors…
         You are worthy!
        
        
        Obtained \summonOdin!

        Obtained \summonLevia!
        
0x0093: Obtained Noah's Lute.
0x0094: Gasp… pant… My age is
        catching up to me…
        Go on,hurry ahead.
0x0095: ‘Well,go on!’
        ‘Don't give up!’
        ‘We're counting on you!’
0x0096: Please rest here tonight.
        The king will meet with
        you tomorrow.
        Good night.
0x0097: Allus:Are you asleep yet?
        “No…”
        
        
        Allus:What could have
         happened to Father?
         Why would he banish his
         child from his castle?
         Doesn't he love me?
        
        
        
        “Of course your father
         loves you,Prince Allus.
         What kind of parents
         don't love their children?”
        Allus:I…
         I guess you're right…
        
        
        “It'll all be made clear
         when we meet with the
         king tomorrow.”
        
        Allus:But I still feel
         somehow frightened…
        
0x0098: The king attacked the
        prince with a knife!
        King:You shall die,Prince!
        
        Allus:Father!!
        
0x0099: Gigames:What are you
         waiting for?
         Kill the prince!
        
        
        -STAB!-
        
        
        King:Urgh…!
        Allus:Father!
        
        
        King:Unh… I shall be
         controlled no longer!
        
0x009A: Gigames:Crap! How could
         you have broken my spell!?
        
        
        King:I'd rather take my own
         life than kill my son!
        
        
        Gigames:Damn you!
         I'll send you both to the
         afterlife together!
         
0x009B: “Wait! Fight us instead!”
        Gigames:What! You!
         I'll take care of you!
0x009C: Allus:Father!
        
        
        
        King:Allus,my son!
         Gigames had me under his
         control for so long…
        Allus:…………
        King:I thought you'd never
         forgive me. But you've
         come back. Thanks to you,
         my soul is free again.
         Please,Allus.
         Take my place and bring
         peace back to Salonia…
         Uhh…
        Allus:Father!!
        King:I love you,Allus…
        
0x009D: “Prince Allus…”
        
        
        
        Allus:Thank you.
         It was only for a moment,
         but I distrusted Father…
        
        “That's not right.
         You loved your father.”
        
        
        Allus:I will take Father's
         place as King of Salonia.
         That was his final wish.
        
         Truly,thank you. Because
         of you we were able to
         defeat Gigames.
        
        “Prince Allus. Take care!”
        Allus:Yes! Thank you,
         Light Warriors!
        
0x009E: Huh?
        Where is everybody…?
0x009F: It's Dorga's voice:
        ‘Leave this cave and
         come to Unne and me!’
0x00A0: Hey!
0x00A1: You can't just come in
        here whenever you like!
        Grumble…
0x00A2: Tree:Thank you…
         I’m finally back.
        Faeries:Thanks to you,this
         forest has been saved!
        Tree:The power of Darkness
         is smothering the world…
         You four are the ones
         chosen by the Light…
         Please,take this. Soon,
         the power of Darkness will
         attempt to block your
         path. This will be of use!
        Received Wind Fang!
        
0x00A3: Tree:I must sleep until
         my body returns to its
         original form…
        
         No one may enter this
         forest for 1000 years.
         Warriors,I am truly in
         your debt.
         Now,go.
         Crush the Darkness!
        
0x00A4: Jiru:Alright,I'll open
         the lock.
         The sewers lie ahead.
0x00A5: Be careful!
0x00A6: ‘Phew! That was close.
         Come on,let's get out
         of here!’
        “Yeah!”
0x00A7: Desh:Here,take this!
         I can't do anything
         with this magic.
         It's \whiteMini.
        Received \whiteMini.
        
        
        
        Desh:Hey,why don't I
         come with you?
        “Uh,we wouldn't mind,but…”
        
        Desh:Then it's decided.
         We're partners!
         Nice meetin’ you!
        
        Desh joined the party!
        
0x00A8: Desh:Let's go!
        “Ready? Jump!”
0x00A9: A voice from the walls:
        ‘Thank you… warriors…’
        “What was that!?”
        
        ‘I am the eldest tree of
         the Living Forest.
         I was put under a curse
         by Hyne…
         But thanks to you,the
         curse has been lifted.
         Thank you,Light Warriors.
        
         Now let us take Hyne's
         captives back to their
         town and return to the
         Living Forest…’
0x00AA: ‘Thanks!’
        ‘Thank you!’
0x00AB: Tree:Alright…
         Let's go home…
         It's a bit shaky, but
         please be patient…
0x00AC: Tree:We've arrived…
         Everyone get off now…
        “Okay,let's go!”
0x00AD: You must return the Eye
        to the sea dragon Nepto…
0x00AE: “Huh?”
        “What's the matter?”
        “That rock's a bit odd…”
        “Now that you mention it…”
0x00AF: Played Noah's Lute…
        The tone said to reach
        even the world of dreams
        echoes through the room…
0x00B0: Unne:Mumble,mumble…
         -yawn-
        
        
        Parrot:Terrific!
         Unne has awakened!
        
0x00B1: Unne:Ahh,I slept well!
         Come on,Parrot,ride on
         my shoulder!
        Parrot:Aye aye sir!
        Unne:Now it's time for
         wake-up exercises!
        
0x00B2: Unne:Presenting…
         Unne of the Dream World!
         Hahahahaha!!
0x00B3: 
                  ?
0x00B4: The journey'll be safe
        if I'm with you guys.
        Let's go!
0x00B5: There's a forest of
        midgets around here,but
        you'd have to be tiny
        yourself to find it!
0x00B6: Aah! We're so tiny…
        Now we can't use swords…
        We can't fight with
        anything but magic!
0x00B7: It's crazy to fight
        without magic as midgets.
        Kill’em with black magic!
0x00B8: Aren't we supposed to
        put Nepto's Eye back in
        the dragon statue?
        Let's return it!
0x00B9: Yeah! We got a ship!
        Now we can search for
        beautiful women all over
        the world…
        Hey,hey!
        I'm kidding!
        
0x00BA: If I remember right…
        The king of Argass knows
        the secret of airships…
        I heard it in Canaan.
0x00BB: I've heard a tribe of bald
        old men who can't see live
        in some valley…
        They're called the Gurgans.
        I've even heard that they
        can tell the future!
        Can it be true!?
        
0x00BC: 
0x00BD: We've got to go to the
        Tower of Owen! I guess
        what that old man said
        was right…
        Destiny awaits!
        
0x00BE: Hmm…
        I feel like I've seen
        this place before!
0x00BF: I… I remember now!
        I'm an Ancient…
0x00C0: If I remember right,
        there's a switch in the
        wall on the fifth floor,
        8 steps from the left!
0x00C1: We have to check on
        the power reactor!
0x00C2: Goldor:Damn you!
         I'd rather do this than
         let you get your filthy
         hands on my Crystal!
0x00C3: “Aaah!!”
        “You broke the Crystal!!”
        
        
        Goldor:I'll never give
         you the Crystal!
         Heheheh……
        
0x00C4: Please take me to
        the Temple of Water.
        There should be a shard
        of the Crystal there…
0x00C5: There is a sealed door
        in the Cave of Water.
        We should be able to get
        in if we have the shard…
0x00C6: I can release the seal
        in the Cave of Water.
        If we give the Crystal
        the Light in this shard…
0x00C7: If we return the Light
        to the Crystal,we may be
        able to bring the world
        back from the sea.
0x00C8: So the Crystal
        has chosen you…
        I sense a very warm
        Light from you.
0x00C9: 
0x00CA: ‘Light Warriors…
         Help…’
        “Are you alright?”
        
        ‘The village of Tokkle…
         Now that they're through
         pillaging it, they're
         going to burn it…
         Please!
         Save Tokkle!’
        
0x00CB: ‘Hyne can change his
         weak point…
         But the Scholar can
         see through that…’
0x00CC: You've come far.
        But the Darkness is three
        steps ahead of you.
        You're too late! Perish!!
0x00CD: Urgh…
        It doesn't matter…
        if you destroy me…
        
        The Dark Cloud is…
        already surrounding
        everything in Darkness……
        
0x00CE: I,the Dark Cloud,have come
        to return all to the Void…
        To turn both Light and
        Dark into nothingness…
        And first I will erase you
        with the power of Light
        from this world!
        Die!!
0x00CF: Cid:\xchar!
        Old man:Don't die!
        Desh:You can't give in yet!
        Allus:Please get up!
        Sara:Don't die!
        “………………”
        ‘\char1[0x02],\char2[0x02],\char3[0x02],
         \char4[0x02]!!’
0x00D0: ‘We will give you our
         spirits. Now stand up!
         Return to life,
         heroes of the Light!
        The party revived!
        
0x00D1: Desh:I'm getting off too!
        “Desh? Why are you going
         to Canaan?”
        
        Desh:…………
        “???”
        Desh:………… Sarina…!
        
        “Ooh,so you're going to
         see that girl!”
        Desh:Cut it out…
         You're embarrassing me!
0x00D2: “We have to go to the
         Dark World.”
        “Alright!”
        “Come on,let's go!”
0x00D3: “It's a spring…”
        “What an odd color.”
        “Let's try drinking it!”
0x00D4: “Thank you! Dorga,Unne!”
        Dorga:Don't thank us!
        Unne:There's still something
         you must do!
        Dorga:Due to Zande's folly,
         the light has weakened,and
         the power of Darkness has
         created something awful.
        Unne:Zande was controlled
         by that dark power…
        Dorga:It is a terribly
         strong force…
        Unne:Our souls will soon
         join all the other souls.
         There's nothing more we
         can do to help you…
        Dorga:Only you can return
         the Dark and Light to
         their original balance!
        
         Now go!
         To the Dark World!
        
0x00D5: Please take me to the
        Magic Circle Cave
        ahead of here. You must
        be a midget to enter it…
        The candle in my room is
        the switch for the door
        to the cave.
        
0x00D6: I'm suffering from an
        illness…
        I do not have the
        strength to stop Zande.
0x00D7: 
0x00D8: The Magic Circle is
        connected to another
        dimension. That is where
        the Eureka Key lies.
0x00D9: Eureka is the land where
        weapons with power too
        great for humans were
        sealed long ago.
0x00DA: Father just suddenly
        became like an entirely
        different person…
        What could have happened?
0x00DB: I've been banished
        from the castle.
        Father told me never
        to come back…
0x00DC: Cannot warp without the
        Crystal's power.
0x00DD: The Great Ship can
        cross mountains.
        We need it if we are to
        obtain the Earth Fang.
        Come on,let's go to the
        Ancient Ruins!
        
0x00DE: The Great Ship's name
        is Invincible. It was
        built by the Ancients.
0x00DF: Noah's gift to Zande,life
        as a human,was the best
        one of all…
        Zande didn't understand…
0x00E0: The Cave of Darkness
        is north of Amur in a
        mountainous area with
        many valleys.
0x00E1: The four Fangs can
        destroy the Statues of
        the Ancients that Zande
        is using!
        Zande should be in the
        Sylx Tower,beyond the
        statues.
        
0x00E2: Dorga:The one trying to
         bring Darkness upon this
         world is Zande.
        
         Zande and I once studied
         under the same teacher.
         That teacher was the
         Archmage Noah.
         When Noah died,he left
         me his magic,Unne the
         Dream World,and Zande
         life as a human.
         Zande was dissatisfied
         with that,and left this
         world.
        
         And now he has caused
         that earthquake using
         the power of the
         Earth Crystal.
        “But Goldor shattered
         the Crystal…”
        
        
        Dorga:Goldor?
         Ah,that was the Crystal
         I created that gives
         birth to gold.
         The Earth Crystal still
         sleeps somewhere…
        
        
         Zande has sealed off the
         power of Light,and is
         trying to summon Darkness
         to make it his power.
         It is a sad affair…
         We have to stop him no
         matter what!
         I'll lend you my help.’
        Dorga joined the party!
        
0x00E3: “Ahh,slept well…”
        HP/MP restored!
0x00E4: Annihilated…
0x00E5: Annihilated…
0x00E6: We're here…
        We must do this quickly.
        It seems I do not have
        much longer to live.
0x00E7: Dorga:First I will enchant
        your ship Nautilus so that
        it can go under the sea…
        Zehapid muh kaine!
0x00E8: Obtained \boomerangFullMoon!
0x00E9: Obtained \darkswordMasamune!
0x00EA: Obtained \swordExcalibur!
0x00EB: ‘The door will only open
         for those with the Light
         of the four Crystals…’
        
        “We need the power of
         the Earth Crystal…”
        
0x00EC: “Hey everybody!”
        
        
        
        Sara:\char1[0x02],\char2[0x02],\char3[0x02],
         \char4[0x02]!
        Cid:You did it!
        Allus:You really did it!
        Old man:I knew you were
         the real thing!
        Desh:Aren't they amazing!
        
        “Come on everyone,let's
         go home!”
        
0x00ED: Elia:You are…
         This place is…?
         Huh!?
         The Light in your hearts!
         The Crystals have given
         their power to you!
         The Crystals have chosen
         Warriors! I’m so glad…
0x00EE: Elia:My name is Elia.
         I am the maiden of the
         Temple of Water.
        “What's happened here?”
        Elia:The power of Earth
         caused an earthquake.
         And the Water Crystal has
         sunken into the ground.
         The people protected by
         the power of Water were
         turned to stone and the
         land sank into the sea.
         If we offer the Crystal
         shard in the Temple
         to the Crystal of Water,
         the curse might be lifted…
0x00EF: “But in your condition…”
        Elia:I'll be fine.
         We must save the world…
         Cough… I beg you!
         Please take me to the
         Temple of Water!
        “All right.”
        Elia:Thank you!!
        Elia joined the party!
        
0x00F0: “Thanks,old man!”
        ‘Ah,it was nothing.
         Well,I guess it's time
         to go back to Amur.’
0x00F1: ‘Hello,everyone!’
        ‘Thank God you're safe!’
        ‘What're you talking about?
         It was a cinch!’
0x00F2: “Thanks to you,the world
         has been saved.”
        ‘Ha! Whenever you run into
         trouble,count on us!’
        ‘Come see us anytime.
         You can train with us!
         Ho ho ho!
         Farewell!’
0x00F3: “It's Salonia!”
        Allus:I'm home…
0x00F4: “Thank you,Prince Allus!
         Err,I mean,King Allus!”
        
        
        Allus:Your hearts of Light
         saved the world.
         It is we who should
         say thanks to you.
         I'll never forget the
         courage you've taught me!
         Truly,thank you so much!
         
0x00F5: “We're approaching Canaan.”
        Cid:We're almost there?
         I’m sure Granny's waiting.
0x00F6: Cid:Granny!
        Cid's wife:Don't do that!
         I’m shy of hugging in
         front of people!
0x00F7: Desh:Sarina!
        Sarina:Desh!
         Don't leave me
         ever again!
        Desh:Never!
         We'll be together
         forever!
        
0x00F8: Cid:……Granny!
        Cid's wife:What are you
         doing! You're hugging me!
         Oh,I give up…
0x00F9: “Ahem… people…”
        Desh:Oh,sorry,sorry!
        Cid:Did I show off
         too much!?
        Desh:Call me when you go

        Sarina:Oh no you don't!!
        
        “Desh,don't let her get
         you under her thumb!”
        Desh:Shaddup!
        
        Cid:Come visit us anytime.
         Granny'll cook you up
         a special meal!

0x00FA: “Princess Sara,let's go
         back to Sasoon Castle.”
        
        
        Sara:No,I don't want to!
         I wanna have fun with
         you a bit more!
         Don't go back just yet.
        “Huh? But,Princess…”
        Sara:Don't be so dull!
         I want to be with you
         a little while longer!

0x0207: Hey,where are you four
        brats off to now?
        
        
        What…? You're going to
        go save the world…?
        Did you get hit on the
        head or something!?
0x0208: 
0x0209: The Elder awaits inside.
0x020A: Oh my!
        How did you get here?
        There are some Potions in
        this well!
0x020B: You'd better take \whiteCure
        from the storehouse ahead.
        Monsters appear along the
        path,so be careful!
0x020C: I'm picking flowers!
0x020D: The candle farthest to the
        right is the switch for a
        hidden door.
        
        The switch on the other
        side is on the north wall!
        
0x020E: Those blessed by the
        Crystals can be healed by
        holy water from shrines.
0x020F: The town of Kazus lies
        to the south. But no one
        dares leave this village
        because of the monsters.
0x0210: This area surrounded by
        the Palmeni mountains is
        ruled by King Sasoon of
        the castle to the west.
0x0211: The Crystal altar sank
        underground in that quake.
        We're doomed…
0x0212: I sensed that something
        had happened to you.
        Now listen to what the
        Elder has to say.
0x0213: The four boys’ adoptive
        mother,Nina:
        ‘Please…
         Take care of yourselves.’
0x0214: One of the Elders,Homac:
        ‘Spiritual “Capacity” is
         needed to use the Jobs
         granted by the Crystals.’
0x0215: The man who raised the
        orphans,Topapa the Elder.
        “Dad! We…”
0x0216: Topapa:I know. I had no
         idea you would be chosen.
         \char1[0x02],\char2[0x02],
         \char3[0x02],\char4[0x02]…
         First you must know that
         this was no accident.
         The Crystals have chosen
         you by their will.
         Don't let their power…
         don't let your hearts of
         Light go to waste!
        
         Begin your journey!
         Seal off the power of
         Darkness!
        
0x0217: Topapa:Go now!
         Begin your journey!
0x0218: You're going on a journey?
        I won't take your money.
        Please rest well.
0x0219: How do you like it?
0x021A: I'll guess your strength!
        Hmm…
        …………
        
        \char1[0x01]
        \char2[0x01]
        \char3[0x01]
        \char4[0x01]
        There. I bet I'm right!
        
0x021B: Zzz… zzz…
0x021C: 
0x021D: Princess Sara, you're safe!
0x021E: You'll need Antidotes and
        Eyedrops if you're going
        on a journey.
0x021F: 
0x0220: With the valley blocked
        by that rock,I haven't
        been able to get back to
        Canaan.
        All there is to do is
        sit here and drink… 
        Hic!
        
0x0221: Hey,try playing the piano!
0x0222: Aieee!!
0x0223: Sorry. I thought you were
        ghosts,too…
        This town is cursed.
        There're ghosts in the Inn!
0x0224: King:Sara! You're safe!
        
        
        
        Sara:Just wait. I'll seal
         Jinn with this ring!
        
        
        King:I'll worry for you…
        Sara:I'll be fine!
         See,I've got \xchar
         with me!
0x0225: If you had an airship,you
        could cross the lake and
        reach the Cave of the Seal
        where Jinn is.
0x0226: Thank you. Because of you,
        we're back to ourselves!
0x0227: The Nelb Valley was blocked
        by a large rock after the
        earthquake.
0x0228: Kazus has grown around the
        Mithril mines. Mithril
        weapons and armor are all
        produced here.
0x0229: This is the Mithril mine.
0x022A: Taca is the best smith
        in town. He lives alone
        in this house.
0x022B: I've been turned into
        this dreadful form by
        Jinn's curse…
0x022C: Thank you. Because of you,
        we're back to ourselves!
0x022D: Jinn who was contained in
        the Cave of the Seal was
        freed in the earthquake.
0x022E: Hey!
        You can't come in here.
0x022F: There was a Mithril Ring
        made for the Princess Sara
        of Sasoon Castle.
        If only you had that ring…
0x0230: There is a secret entrance
        at the end of the mine.
        Try the wall three steps
        from the left.
0x0231: The only thing which can
        reseal Jinn is the Mithril
        Ring made in this town.
0x0232: I'm Cid,from Canaan.
        The Nelb valley got blocked
        by a boulder and I wasn't
        able to go back to Canaan.
        So I decided to stay the
        night at the Inn here,
        and then this happened!
        Hohoho!
        Will you help me if I
        lend you my Airship?
        It's hidden in the
        desert to the west.
        Heard about the Airship
        in the western desert!!
        
0x0233: I want my pretty
        face back…
0x0234: Thanks to you I got my
        pretty face back!
        Teehee!
0x0235: Cid:We have to crush that
         boulder,but…
         Maybe if you put a Mithril
         bow on the airship?
        Taca:Just a minute!
         I'll do it right away!
        
0x0236: Taca:It's finished!
         No need to thank me.
         You kids saved the
         whole village!
        Cid:Now we have to smash
         the boulder with the
         Airship!
        
0x0237: Good luck!
0x0238: Everyone's been turned
        into ghosts by Jinn.
        Since I was away on a
        mission I was spared…
        If I had a Mithril Ring
        I could reseal Jinn,
        but the village of Kazus,
        where the ring is made,
        is in the same condition…
        What should I do…
        
0x0239: Thank you!
        Please go see the King.
        He says he has something
        to give you.
0x023A: There is a “Wight Slayer”
        in the left tower.
        It's a holy sword with
        power against undead.
        But only a Red Wizard
        can wield it.
        
0x023B: The monsters in the Cave
        of the Seal are all undead.
        You might defeat them by
        casting \whiteCure on them…
0x023C: There is a secret route
        to the treasure room in
        this castle.
0x023D: I've been turned into
        this dreadful form by
        Jinn's curse…
0x023E: Thank you,warriors!
0x023F: ‘I am the king of Sasoon.
         We have all been turned
         into ghosts by Jinn's
         curse.
         We cannot return to our
         original form until
         Jinn is defeated.’
        
        “Where is Jinn?”
        
        
        
        ‘In the Cave of the Seal
         north of this castle.
         But without a Mithril Ring
         Jinn cannot be resealed.’
        “I heard that Princess
         Sara has one…”
        
        
        ‘Oh,yes! A while ago a
         Mithril Ring was sent
         to Sara from Kazus.
        
         But no one can find
         that irresponsible girl
         anywhere. Could she have
         been kidnapped by Jinn?!
         Oh,Princess Sara…’
        
        
        
        “We'll go look for her in
         the Cave of the Seal.”
        ‘Ah,thank you.
        
         If I remember correctly,
         there is a hidden door in
         the cave. The skeletons
         should be the key…
         Please!
         Defeat Jinn and save us!’
        
0x0240: I thank you sincerely
        for resealing Jinn and
        rescuing Princess Sara.
        
        Please take this.
        It may be of use to you.
        
        
        Received Canoe!
        
0x0241: Sara:The truth is,I
         want to go with you…
         But I'm sure I'd just
         get in the way…
        “Princess Sara…”
        
        
        
        Sara:Come see me when
         your journey is over.
         I'll be waiting!
        
0x0242: Princess Sara talks
        about you every day!
0x0243: Princess Sara wanted
        to see you!
        Her room is at the top
        of the right tower.
0x0244: Thank you,warriors!
0x0245: ‘I'm Sara,the daughter
         of King Sasoon.’
        
        
        “Princess Sara,why did you
         come to such a place?”
        
        
        Sara:Since I was wearing
         the Mithril Ring,I wasn't
         put under Jinn's curse.
        
         I came here to help
         everyone,but I can't make
         it any further because of
         the monsters…
        “This place is dangerous.
         Princess Sara,please
         wait at the castle.”
        
        Sara:No! I’m going!
         I'll keep going alone if
         I have to!
        
0x0246: Sara:Take me with you!
         You can't seal Jinn
         without this Mithril Ring!
        
        “Seems we have no choice…”
        
        
        
        Sara joined the party!
        
0x0247: Cid:Oh no,Granny got
         worse while I was away…
         If only we had the
         magical medicine,Elixir…
0x0248: Cid:Now I've been
         helped by you twice.
         …………
         Oh,right!
         Try pushing the candle
         on that wall there.
         It opens the way to
         my old storage area.
         Maybe you'll find
         something of use.
        
0x0249: The Crystal is shedding
        its light silently…
        ‘Light Warriors,bring
         hope back to this world…’
0x024A: Cough,cough!
0x024B: If you go all the way
        around the continent on
        a chocobo,I'll give you
        a prize!
0x024C: You've done me and my
        husband a huge favor.
        Thank you so much.
0x024D: “Put the Dwarf Horn here?”
        Dwarf:Yes,please do!
0x024E: I heard that a traveling
        wizard hid a magic potion
        somewhere in this town…
0x024F: It's said that there's a
        town of midgets in a
        forest south of here.
0x0250: You can become tiny with
        the magic \whiteMini,but
        I've sold the last one to
        a guy called Desh.
0x0251: What…? Desh…?
        That jerk swindled our
        daughter Sarina.
        I don't know what to do…
        He went off on a trip,
        saying there was something
        he had to search for.
        Sarina won't stop crying…
0x0252: Sarina:Oh… Desh…
         Even though I feel so
         much for you…
         Sob,sob…
         You went to the southern
         mountain where they say
         a dragon lives…
        
0x0253: The magic \whiteAero uses
        the wind to cause damage.
        It really works well on
        monsters that fly!
0x0254: A traveler called Desh
        came through this town.
        But he soon went off
        somewhere again.
0x0255: What is it?
0x0256: Wark!!
0x0257: -rustle-
0x0258: ‘Whoa,what a surprise to
         run into someone here!
         Did you get caught by
         that dragon too?’
        “And you are…?”
        
        
        
        ‘Oh yeah,heh.
         I’m Desh.’
        “I'm \xchar.”
        
        Desh:I can't remember
         anything besides my name.
         I know there's something
         I've gotta do…
         But I have no idea what
         it could be…
        
0x0259: Desh:Uh oh!!
         The dragon's back!
         Hide!!
0x025A: Desh:There's no way we'll
         ever win fighting it!
         Run away! Run away!!
0x025B: ‘Hey!
         You're Desh!’
        
        
        Desh:Uh,no… You must be
         mistaking me for someone…
        
0x025C: Sarina:Desh!!
        
        
        
        Desh:I'm sorry. There's
         something I must do.
        Sarina:I'll be waiting…
        
0x025D: You're new around here,
        aren't you.
0x025E: There is a tunnel which
        pierces through the
        Myranos mountains.
        
        If you pass through it,
        you'll come into the
        Myraluka valley where
        the Vikings live.
0x025F: Please stay around awhile.
        Sara really wanted to
        see you.
0x0260: We're the midgets.
        We're a content people!
0x0261: I've heard there's a
        Living Forest somewhere.
        I wonder if the faeries
        there are cute!
0x0262: Dr.Shelco's stomach is
        hurting terribly! No one
        can help him. He's the
        only doctor in the village!
0x0263: 
0x0264: Strange smell…
0x0265: Uhh… ooh…
        Antidote…
        Please……
0x0266: “I feel a power welling
         up inside me!”
        
0x0267: 
0x0268: Thank you for helping me.
        Be careful!
0x0269: Dr.Shelco knows a secret
        route to Myraluka valley.
0x026A: Midget Bread possesses
        magical power.
        It's the same power as
        the magic \whiteSight!
0x026B: You can see the world
        using Midget Bread!
0x026C: It's a wall of flame.
0x026D: Congratulations on
        circling the continent
        on a chocobo!
        Here's your prize!
        Received Midget Bread!
        
0x026E: We're the Vikings!
        Lords of the sea!
        …………
        ……Well……
        Actually,we have a problem.
        After the quake,the sea
        dragon went berserk and
        destroyed our ships.
        Only the Enterprise was
        spared,but everyone's
        afraid to set sail.
        
0x026F: 
0x0270: Even the boss doesn't know
        what to do.
        We're no match for the
        sea dragon…
0x0271: You've got guts!
        Thanks!!
0x0272: A Viking that can't sail…!
        What can I do but drink!?
0x0273: 
0x0274: Hmph,I'll just stay in bed…
0x0275: Now I can sleep peacefully…
0x0276: The building on the cape
        is the Nepto Shrine.
        The old man should know
        a lot about it!
0x0277: 
0x0278: The Enterprise is intact.
        But no one dares to sail!
        You'd just be killed by
        the sea dragon.
0x0279: 
0x027A: I… I’m not hiding…!
        I'm just waiting for the
        old man to come up.
0x027B: 
0x027C: You shouldn't be sailing!
        If you go past the cape,
        the sea dragon will attack.
        
        That has to be the sea
        dragon Nepto enshrined
        at the Nepto Shrine…
        
0x027D: Oh my God!
        You guys are SO GREAT!
0x027E: That there's the boss.
0x027F: 
0x0280: It's hopeless…
        We'll never beat the sea
        dragon…
        
        If you get rid of the
        sea dragon for us you can
        have the Enterprise!
        How's that sound?
0x0281: Awesome!
        You guys are real heroes!
        As I promised,the
        Enterprise is now yours!
0x0282: I'm the very oldest of
        the Vikings. The Nepto
        Shrine is where the dragon
        Nepto used to sleep.
        But something happened
        since the earthquake,and
        the dragon went mad…
        
0x0283: Thank you,youngsters!
        The sea dragon Nepto has
        finally calmed down.
0x0284: Make good use of the
        Dwarves’ treasure,lali!
0x0285: 
0x0286: It's a statue of Nepto.
        One of the eyes is missing
        and there is a small hole
        leading beyond…
        “I wonder if we could get
         in if we became tiny?”
        
0x0287: A Dwarf Horn was stolen!
        Lali laliho!
0x0288: Both of the horns have
        been stolen!
        Lali laliho,lali!!
0x0289: We give you the treasure
        of the Dwarves as thanks!
        Moonwalk will be your
        guide,lali!
0x028A: The sea dragon Nepto
        rests in a deep sleep.
0x028B: Squeek! I won't give this
        gem to anyone! Squeeek!
0x028C: Obtained Nepto's Eye!
0x028D: Aaah!
        There's nothing left for
        you to take!
0x028E: You've saved us.
        Thank you!
0x028F: Eeek!
        Please don't kill me!
0x0290: 
0x0291: There are demons in
        the western desert…
        They're moving a huge
        tree around!
0x0292: The people taken by Hyne
        have come back to us.
        Thank you so much.
0x0293: You saved us all.
        Truly,thank you so much.
0x0294: The guys who killed Hyne!
        You kick ass!
0x0295: ‘This is the emblem that
         the soldiers who attacked
         the village dropped.’
        
        “It couldn't be…
         King Argass!?”
        
0x0296: 
0x0297: People who call themselves
        the descendants of the
        Ancients live to the west,
        across the desert.
0x0298: 
0x0299: Please,spare the children!
0x029A: Hmm? Oh,you're different.
        I'm sorry. I thought the
        soldiers who attacked the
        village had come again…
        Sob… They took my husband…
        They took him into the
        desert. The men wearing
        the crest of Argass…
0x029B: I wonder if he's alright…
        Oh,please be alive!
0x029C: My husband is safe!
        Thank you so much!
0x029D: Sarina:What!!
         Into the flame of the
         Tower of Owen!?
        
        “I'm sure he's alive.”
        Sarina:Oh,Desh!
         Please be alright!
        
0x029E: Thanks guys!
0x029F: Thanks to you I've
        returned safely home
        from Hyne's castle.
0x02A0: This is the elder's house.
        Please hear what the elder
        has to say.
0x02A1: 
0x02A2: I am the elder.
        Ever since the earthquake,
        soldiers have been coming
        from the desert and
        taking away the village's
        young people and food…
        It's because of them the
        village is in this state.
0x02A3: 
0x02A4: There is a secret passage
        in the fireplace. There
        are weapons hidden there
        but we cannot use them.
        I beg you.
        Please save the village.
        
0x02A5: 
0x02A6: We are the faeries of
        this forest.
0x02A7: The wizard who abducted
        the Eldest Tree can change
        his weakness.
0x02A8: This forest is alive.
0x02A9: The forest is crying…
        The Eldest Tree has been
        cursed by a wizard and
        taken away somewhere.
0x02AA: Unless the Eldest Tree
        returns,this forest will
        soon die…
0x02AB: The Eldest Tree was carved
        into the shape of a castle
        and wanders the desert…
        Please,help him!
0x02AC: A wizard of Argass Castle,
        Hyne,is the one who cursed
        the Eldest Tree.
0x02AD: Hyne uses “WallChange”.
        He can change his own
        weak point.
0x02AE: This is the valley of
        the Gurgans.
0x02AF: You must go to the
        Crystals of Fire,Water
        and Earth. Then you will
        gain even greater power…
0x02B0: The power of Earth has
        sealed the Light of the
        other three Crystals…
        And its own as well…?
0x02B1: That earthquake was but
        an omen. The tremors that
        pulled the Crystals into
        the earth and brought
        forth monsters were minor
        compared to the Darkness
        which is to come…
        
0x02B2: The power of Fire is in
        the island of the Dwarves…
0x02B3: Use this to enter the
        Tower of Owen to the
        north.
        Desh… Your destiny awaits.
        Received \whiteToad!
        
0x02B4: The Tower of Owen is a
        mechanical device…
        Desh's destiny awaits.
0x02B5: When the tower emits a red
        flame,it is about to fall…
        At that time a man who is
        to alter fate shall awaken.
0x02B6: If people knew the future,
        it would only bring them
        sadness.
0x02B7: I can see neither light
        nor dark in the future…
        It is all unclear…
0x02B8: The Living Forest is
        calling you…
0x02B9: We are descendants of the
        Ancients who built an
        advanced civilization.
0x02BA: The Flood of Light…
        The Ancients used the
        Crystals and manipulated
        the power of Light.
        But the Light began to
        destroy the world.
        It was too great a power
        for humans to wield.
        Then four warriors came
        from the Dark World and
        forced back the Flood
        of Light.
        But the Ancients had
        already mostly perished.
        The few survivors moved
        to this land.
0x02BB: This continent is
        floating in the sky.
        It was conceived by the
        Ancients’ civilization.
        And it still floats today…
        The Tower of Owen is what
        gives it power.
        
0x02BC: Our law…
        It is to entrust ourselves
        to the greater will. We
        mustn't rely on machines.
0x02BD: When something occurs,
        Light or Dark select four
        people and entrust them
        with their power…
        It is said there were four
        Dark Warriors who saved
        the world from the Flood
        of Light.
        And now you have been
        chosen by the Light…
        Do not abuse its power!
        
0x02BE: To the east is a forest
        where birds known as
        “chocobos” live.
0x02BF: Under Sir Zande's orders,
        I,Medusa,shall destroy
        this tower and drop this
        continent out of the sky!
        Heeheehee…
        You can't stop me!
        Perish!!
        
0x02C0: The flame is blowing
        violently.
        It could explode any time…
0x02C1: Desh:Wait! It's dangerous!
         My memory's come back.
         I’m the surviving Ancient
         guardian of this tower.
         I was asleep for ages…
         But when something
         happened to the tower,
         I was awakened.
         I must have lost it
         from sleeping so long…
        
0x02C2: Desh:This is bad…
         But we may have a chance.
         I've gotta go in here and
         fix the reactor…
         Otherwise the Floating
         Continent will lose its
         power and fall.
        
         I guess this is it,guys…
         Thanks for everything.
        
0x02C3: “Desh!! You'll be killed!!”
0x02C4: Desh:This is my mission…
        
        
        
         Once I stop the eddy in
         the strait,you go to the
         island of Dwarves.
         Got it?
         That's where the power
         of Fire should be.
        
        
         Once I'm down below,I'll
         warp you outta here.
         Well,see ya!
         This is it!!
0x02C5: “Desh…!!”
0x02C6: “Desh!”
        
        
        
        “I guess he's died…”
        
0x02C7: Lali ho!
0x02C8: Two horns of Ice.
        The Dwarves’ treasure!
        But a bad guy stole ’em…
        We can't forgive him!
0x02C9: Thank you!
        Take this in thanks!
        You can get more of
        them in Gisahl!
        Received Magic Key!
        
0x02CA: Guzco stole the Dwarves’
        treasure,the two horns!
        He dove into the lake!
0x02CB: I can't believe it!
        Guzco's gotten both
        of the horns…
        Terrible,terrible!
0x02CC: Thank you!
        The Dwarves’ treasure,
        the two horns,has been
        returned!
0x02CD: Lali ho!
        The horns have returned!
        Woohoo! Lali ho!!
0x02CE: We've put a spell around
        the remaining horn so
        no one can get near it!
0x02CF: Thank you!
        You got our horns back!
        Please return them to
        their original place!
0x02D0: That guy headed for the
        mountain to the north!
        Please!
        Bring back the two horns!
0x02D1: A beautiful crystal tower
        used to stand on the north
        mountain. But now there's
        just a cave there!
0x02D2: Takeoff!
0x02D3: Ouch!
0x02D4: Aagh! Stay back!
        I won't give you the horn!
        Die!
0x02D5: Obtained Dwarf Horn.
0x02D6: I came from the forest of
        midgets to the south. The
        town in the forest can
        only be found by midgets!
0x02D7: Far to the east across
        the Outer Sea is a village
        called Gisahl!
0x02D8: Oh my,how long has it been
        since anybody's come to
        this town in the middle
        of nowhere!?
0x02D9: 
0x02DA: I'm raising sheep…
0x02DB: Hey! Don't go over there!
0x02DC: These Carrots are the
        Chocobo's favourite food.
        Want to know the secret
        of the Chocobo forests?
        Try using a Carrot on the

0x02E1: ‘I am king Argass of the
         castle north of the
         desert. But I suppose
         no one is there now…
         The soldiers are being
         controlled by Hyne.
        
        
         Hyne used to be my
         trusted assistant…
         Cough,cough…’
        
        “Are you alright?”
        ‘I'm fine.
         Please,defeat Hyne!’
0x02E2: Hyne is Argass’ minister.
        After the great earthquake
        he was possessed by an
        evil power.
0x02E3: This castle was made by
        uprooting the Eldest Tree
        of the Living Forest.
0x02E4: I'm already done for…
        Use this to become tiny.
        Escape through the hole
        in the wall in the corner…
        Received LuckMallet.
        
0x02E5: Hyne gained some kind of
        power,and has given in to
        the desires born of that
        power…
0x02E6: Hyne is hiding the King's
        sword somewhere.
0x02E7: What?
        Defeat Sir Hyne?
        I'm a servant of Sir Hyne!
        Die!!
0x02E8: Hyne:Magnificent…
         How lovely this power
         of Darkness is…
        
         You cannot comprehend its

         and now I shall become
         the ruler of this world!

        They've got a smith who

        Truly,thank you.
        
        Please,have this.
        This is the “Time Gear”.
        It has been in the royal
        family for generations.
        They say it was created
        by the Ancients.
        Take this to a man named
        Cid who lives in Canaan.
        Oh,you know Cid?
        Then I need say no more.
        Go,warriors!
        
        Received Time Gear!
        
0x02F1: Go to Canaan!
        Give the Time Gear to Cid!
0x02F2: So Cid built an airship!
        The world is boundless.
        Fly off of this Floating
        Continent!
0x02F3: This land we stand on is
        a Floating Continent!
0x02F4: The Time Gear…
        It was once also called
        the “Perpetual Engine”…
0x02F5: Thieves can open locked
        doors without a key!
0x02F6: The rightmost of the four
        flames is the switch for
        a secret door.
0x02F7: Thank you,warriors!
0x02F8: I'm researching Elixirs.
        Please,take these two
        Elixirs I made by accident!
        
        Received 2 Elixirs!
        
0x02F9: It's a campfire.
0x02FA: It's a Dwarf Horn.
0x02FB: A rock blocks the path.
0x02FC: It's a chocobo!
0x02FD: I used to work for King
        Argass. I'd build airships
        with the Time Gear!
        I'm famous! Hahaha!
0x02FE: Knights guard those who
        are low on HP.
0x02FF: Found a chocobo!
0x0300: 
0x0301: After the earthquake,the
        world sank into the sea…
        Luckily,I happened to be
        aboard a boat.
        The only survivors were
        myself and that girl
        sleeping in back.
        
0x0302: Old man:Are you alright?
        Elia:Thank you,sir!
        Old man:Don't mention it.
         Take care of yourself!
0x0303: Elia:Uunh…
0x0304: 
0x0305: Elia:There is still some
         Light left in this shard.
         Come on,let's go to the
         cave north of here!
0x0306: Something is written:
        ‘The seal shall open
         with the Sylx Key.’
0x0307: The Crystal is shedding
        its light silently…
        ‘Light Warriors,bring
         hope back to this world…’
0x0308: 
0x0309: “You've helped a lot.
         Thank you.”
        ‘You're welcome!’
0x030A: You seem to be alright.
        That's good.
0x030B: 
0x030C: I feel like I've been
        dreaming for a long time…
0x030D: A guy called Goldor put
        a chain on your ship.
0x030E: Come back again!
0x030F: Goldor's mansion is south
        of Amur. But you have to
        cross a bottomless swamp.
        If you fall in,you'll die!
0x0310: Whoa!
        Your ship can fly!?
0x0311: Four warriors came from
        the Dark World and stopped
        the Flood of Light from
        the Crystals…
        Goldor,thinking you were
        those four warriors,put
        a chain on your ship so
        you won't get his Crystal.
0x0312: The old man who saved Elia:
        ‘What? Elia…
         I see…
         …………
         How tragic… Please,for
         Elia's sake too, bring the
         Light back to this world.
         We're counting on you!’
0x0313: There's a huge city
        called Salonia somewhere.
        I've heard that they have
        a really fast Airship…
0x0314: The Crystal?
        A guy named Goldor who
        lives to the south has
        one.
0x0315: Go see Salonia.
        It's a very large walled
        city.
0x0316: Everything in Goldor's
        mansion is made of gold!
        He's put locks everywhere
        so no one can steal it!
0x0317: Wearing Floating Shoes you
        can cross the Bottomless
        Swamp.
        
        Didn't that old lady Delila
        who lives in the sewers
        have them?
        
0x0318: Goldor is terribly strong
        against magic!
        He has perfect magic
        defense!
0x0319: Been to the Amur Pub?
        It's full of news!
0x031A: The sewers are locked up
        because of the monsters
        that have been coming out.
        Old Jiru has the key…
0x031B: 
0x031C: Jiru:What do you want?
        
        
        
        “We want to go into the
         sewers so we can get the
         Floating Shoes…”
        
        Jiru:Into the sewers!
         They're closed because
         of all the monsters.
         It's dangerous!
        “But we have to find the
         last of the Crystals.”
        Jiru:What!? You're the
         legendary four warriors!
0x031D: ‘What? The four warriors?’
        ‘That's who we are!’
        ‘Seems like they're going
         into the sewers…’
        ‘Well then,we'll get
         there first!’
        
0x031E: Jiru:Come along now,
         follow me!
0x031F: Jiru:Hang in there!
0x0320: 
0x0321: Locked.
0x0322: There's a legend…
        That four warriors will
        crush the overflowing of
        Light and Dark.
0x0323: Old men:
0x0324: “Who are those old guys!?”
        ‘Those old men…
         They think that they're
         the legendary heroes!’
0x0325: No,what I just used wasn't
        actually \whiteExit,it was
        an OtterHead!
0x0326: We're heroes too!
0x0327: Something in your eyes…
        Maybe you really can do it.
0x0328: You may be stronger,but
        we're better with the
        women!
0x0329: I'm not a match for you
        youngsters after all,huh?
        I'll just stay here.
0x032A: You're really the four
        legendary heroes?
        But I thought that was us!
0x032B: Thanks!
0x032C: We still need to train
        some more!
0x032D: How are the four old men
        doing?
0x032E: I won't let you have my
        Crystal!
        Die!!
0x032F: 
0x0330: 
0x0331: 
0x0332: It's the lock to Goldor's
        chain.
        When touched,it vanished
        into thin air.
0x0333: “The chain is released,
         but the Crystal's in
         pieces…
         What will we do?”
0x0334: 
0x0335: There is an undersea cave
        at a small triangular
        island. It's full of
        treasure!
0x0336: Go away!
        This library is closed!
0x0337: There once was a passage
        from the castle cellar
        to the seafloor…
        But now it's blocked up.
        Maybe one could enter from
        the bottom of the sea!
        
0x0338: We're excavating the
        Ancient Ruins.
0x0339: The cave was filled with
        Adamantite so we can't
        proceed ahead.
0x033A: The cave walls collapsed
        in the earthquake.
        Our advance party should
        be beyond,but…
0x033B: I have a feeling something
        extraordinary lies in
        these ruins…
0x033C: A band of merchants snuck
        weapons and armor out of
        the Ancient Ruins and are
        selling them.
0x033D: Bahamut,Leviathan,Odin…
        If you have these three
        as allies,they will grant
        you Summon magic.
0x033E: Every painting found in
        the ruins has what looks
        like a gigantic ship on it.
0x033F: I came from Fargabaad to
        improve my skills.
        
        
        The monsters here can't be
        killed with normal swords.
        Instead,they'll just split
        in two.
0x0340: ‘…………’
        “You alright?”
        
        
        ‘Seems I was not yet
         experienced enough…
         Please,take this……’
        
        Received \darkswordKotetsu!
        
0x0341: Cannot proceed ahead.
0x0342: 
0x0343: 
0x0344: Zzz… zzz…
0x0345: Controlling terrain is a
        difficult thing to do.
        Sometimes,the damage will
        backfire on oneself.
0x0346: Geomancers can use the
        terrain as a weapon.
0x0347: I heard that there is an
        amazingly fast airship
        in Salonia.
0x0348: Southeast of this island
        is the continent Dalug.
        The wind there blows back
        everything.
0x0349: I heard there are swords
        born of darkness called
        “dark swords”. I have
        been searching for those…
0x034A: The shadow of the lake…
        Leviathan. He awaits the
        time he can be freed from
        the bonds of Darkness…
0x034B: The Dragon King Bahamut.
        When one who can defeat
        him appears,his heart will
        grant the ultimate power…
0x034C: Odin feared the use of
        his own power.
        And so he sealed himself…
0x034D: Long ago…
        Humans took the power of
        Light into their hands.
        
        And the power of Light
        that overflowed was about
        to destroy the world…
        
        At that time,four warriors
        came from the Dark World
        to return the Light to its
        original place…
0x034E: This is when you get
        an item!
0x034F: Chocobo Chocobo Cho-Co-Bo!
        Chocobo Chocobo
        Chocobo Chocobo
        Yeah!
0x0350: I can never summon
        anything good…
        Grr!!
0x0351: Darn it!
        Another Chocobo.
        I'm hopeless…
0x0352: Sealed.
0x0353: 
0x0354: It is said that Noah could
        summon Leviathan and the
        Dragon King Bahamut…
0x0355: It is said that Leviathan
        and Bahamut were sealed
        on the Floating Continent
        by Noah…
0x0356: Monsters summoned by
        Summoners are stronger
        than those summoned by
        Conjurers.
0x0357: Summoned monsters are not
        affected by an enemy's
        Barrier. They still inflict
        the same damage!
0x0358: In the past there was
        an Archmage named Noah.
        They say he used
        terrific magic…
0x0359: I am one of the Gurgans…
0x035A: Just as long ago Light
        flooded the world,now the
        power of Darkness is about
        to flood the world…
        Someone is summoning the
        Darkness…
        
        
        That person does not know
        that even though at first
        the Dark World may spread…
        
        Eventually both the Light
        and Dark Worlds which have
        lost their balance will
        become Void…
0x035B: The continent of Dalug is
        where the Archmage Noah
        is said to have lived.
0x035C: I've heard that one of
        Noah's pupils sleeps in
        a fjord to the south.
0x035D: I'm researching Chocobos.
        I can even summon a
        Fat Chocobo.
        Alright now…
        Presenting…
        The Fat Chocobo!
        
0x035E: 
0x035F: Please listen to my song…
0x0360: 
0x0361: The side that loses
        will be executed.
0x0362: For some reason we have
        to fight our allies!
0x0363: Charge!!
0x0364: By order of the King all
        shops have been closed.
        I hear there's one weapon
        shop defying the order.
0x0365: Thanks to you peace has
        returned to Salonia!
0x0366: The King has split Salonia's
        army in two and is making
        them fight!
0x0367: 
0x0368: Salonia is divided into
        four blocks.
0x0369: Salonia's library has
        all sorts of books.
0x036A: 
0x036B: This is Salonia's library,
        but it's closed for now…
0x036C: Go check out the library.
        It should have information
        you need.
0x036D: If the war continues,
        Salonia will become a
        burnt ruin.
0x036E: 
0x036F: There's a rumor that
        Prince Allus was banished
        from the castle…
0x0370: 
0x0371: I saw a child who looked
        like the Prince go into
        the Pub.
0x0372: The retainer's shadow was
        in the shape of a giant
        bird. Could it be the
        legendary bird Garuda…?
0x0373: Thank you,warriors!
0x0374: The King won't hear anyone.
        If you question him you'll
        be killed on the spot.
0x0375: 
0x0376: 
0x0377: 
0x0378: Please forgive me!
0x0379: 
0x037A: By order of the King,
        Salonia Castle is closed.
0x037B: Guard:No one can enter
         the castle!
         Go away!
0x037C: Guard:Oh,it's Prince Allus.
        Allus:Let me in.
        Guard:You've been banished.
         I cannot let you inside.
0x037D: Guard:What? The King said
         to let you pass?
        Allus:Yes.
        
        Guard:I apologize,Prince.
         Please,enter.
        
0x037E: This is it!
        He went inside this Pub!
0x037F: Old man:Oh! Prince Allus!
        Allus:Shh! I’m banished
         from the castle.
         Don't speak so loudly!
        Old man:I'm sorry.
        
0x0380: Light Warriors who
        saved Salonia!
        Thank you!!
0x0381: 
0x0382: 
0x0383: 
0x0384: 
0x0385: 
0x0386: The BEST!!
0x0387: I must not grieve forever…
        
        
        
        As my father wished,I will
        restore peace to Salonia.
        No,not only Salonia,but
        the entire world!
        Maybe there's something
        here in Salonia that could
        be of use to you. Please,
        use anything you'd like!
0x0388: It is said that the
        Archmage Noah divided his
        power among three people:
        Zande,Dorga,and Unne.
0x0389: The only ones who could
        cause such a catastrophe
        are the three wizards of
        the continent of Dalug.
        With the Nautilus’ engine,
        you should be able to fly
        through the winds that
        blow out at the peninsula.
        Light Warriors,head for
        the continent of Dalug!
        
0x038A: Noah's Lute…
        The tone that reaches even
        the Dream World now rests
        in the Temple of Time…
0x038B: The temple that sunk
        into the sea…
        It rests south of Salonia
        below the “two horns”…
0x038C: There is a hidden passage
        to the treasure room on

        But he felt the human life
        he was given by Noah was
        insignificant,and left
        this place.
0x03A6: We heard from Dorga that
        the great earthquake was
        caused by Zande…
0x03A7: There is magical water

        Ah! This place is good!
        Oh,I heard about you in
        my dreams from Dorga.
        I can't believe Zande
        would do such a thing…
        Anyway,first we've got to
        to get the Great Ship.
        It can cross mountains!
        
        It must be in the Ancient

        “What's this…?”
        
        Unne:The two Fangs you
         have and this one are the
         only things which can
         destroy the Statues.
         There's still one more

0x03BD: Long ago there were those
        who mastered both the dark
        swords and the holy swords
        and could use all weapons…

        test their skill but no
        one has ever come back.
        
0x03C3: Some monsters split in
